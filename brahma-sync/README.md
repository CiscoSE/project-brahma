# Command Line

This is a standalone Python client to troubleshoot and develop the ACI APIC
model generation that gets applied to the ACI environment.

Please note: while the predefined credentials in the config.py file point to
the dCloud ACI environment - which you must reserve and VPN into for this code
to function - you are required to set up the initial switch discovery so that
the predefined spine/leaf and sample.py data values match.
